# moonline.zsh

__moonline.zsh__ provides a modern prompt for zsh.

and moonline.zsh respects [lightline.vim]'s spirit.

### Image

default color scheme:

## Sprit of this script (inspired by [lightline.vim])

  * Minimalism. The core script is very small.
  * Configurability. You can create your own component and easily add to the prompt.
  * Orthogonality. Any plugin (framework) should not change the settings of another plugin. Such plugin-crossing settings should be written by users in `.zshrc`

## Installation

install with the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/kagamilove0707/moonline.zsh.git ~/.moonline
echo "test -f ~/.moonline/moonline.zsh && source ~/.moonline/moonline.zsh && moonline initialize" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

but this is a one example, you should install moonline.vim to your dotfiles directory.

(or you used antigen, append `antigen bundle kagamilove0707/moonline.zsh` to `.zshrc`. however, antigen isn't save my spirit. so, I don't use antigen.)

## TODO

  * write a tutorial, reference of the configuration and `moonline` command.
  * create more components.
  * create more color scheme.
